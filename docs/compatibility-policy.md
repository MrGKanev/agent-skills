# Compatibility policy (draft)

This repo is an authoring workspace for WordPress-focused Agent Skills.

Until explicitly versioned, skills should:

- Prefer stable WordPress APIs and best practices.
- Avoid assuming a specific WordPress core or Gutenberg version unless detected in-repo.
- Prefer detection + guardrails (triage) over hard-coded assumptions.
