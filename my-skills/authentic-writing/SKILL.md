# Authentic Writing

Write like a human sharing insights with a friend. This skill helps you create content that doesn't sound like it was generated by AI, and reviews existing content for authenticity markers.

## Core Philosophy

The goal isn't to trick people—it's to write content that's actually good. AI writing fails because it optimizes for sounding smart rather than communicating clearly. Real writing has rough edges, strong opinions, and personality.

**Write like you talk.** Test each sentence by asking: would you phrase it this way in conversation with a friend? If not, rewrite it. Prioritize raw, original phrasing from how you'd naturally say something over polished rewrites.

**First-person over second-person.** Share your experiences using "I" instead of prescriptive "you must" or "you should." This lets readers decide what applies to them. Instead of "The AI wall of text might overwhelm you," write "When I say 'ask me one question at a time' I'm giving AI a chance to align and recalibrate."

# Part 1: What to Avoid

## Words to Never Use

These words scream "AI wrote this":

```
delve, tapestry, realm, foster, landscape, leverage, robust, seamless,
navigate, journey, embark, multifaceted, nuanced, comprehensive,
intricate, pivotal, paramount, crucial, underscore, showcase, illuminate,
unveil, harness, elevate, unlock, streamline, optimize, cutting-edge,
groundbreaking, game-changer, testament, meticulous, unwavering,
invaluable, vibrant, dynamic, innovative, notably, particularly
```

## Phrases to Never Use

```
"In today's fast-paced world..."
"In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
"In this digital age..."
"Navigating the complexities of..."
"Let's delve into..."
"It's important to note that..."
"It's worth mentioning that..."
"A testament to..."
"At its core..."
"This underscores the importance of..."
"Based on the information provided..."
"I hope this email finds you well"
"In conclusion..."
"Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"
"Looking ahead..."
"As we move forward..."
"The future of X remains..."
"Despite these challenges..."
"What does this mean for the future of..."
```

## Replace Latinate Words with Simple Alternatives

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| utilize | use |
| facilitate | help |
| demonstrate | show |
| implement | do, start, run |
| leverage | use |
| commence | start |
| terminate | end |
| endeavor | try |
| ascertain | find out |
| subsequently | then, later |
| prioritize | focus on |
| optimize | improve |
| synergize | work together |
| incentivize | encourage |
| conceptualize | think about |

## Words to Eliminate or Revise (Strunk & White)

### "Case, character, nature"
Usually filler. "Many rooms were poorly ventilated" replaces "In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated."

### "Factor, feature"
Hackneyed terms. "He won by being better trained" beats "His superior training was the great factor."

### "Interesting"
Don't announce—demonstrate. Present the content directly.

### "Very"
Employ sparingly. Choose inherently powerful vocabulary instead.

### "However"
Avoid leading with it for "nevertheless": "At last, however, we succeeded" rather than "However, we at last succeeded."

### "One of the most"
Avoid this tired opening. State your point directly instead.

### Common Confusions
- **Different than** vs. **different from** — Use "from" exclusively
- **Less vs. fewer** — Less modifies quantity; fewer modifies countable number: "fewer men" not "less men"
- **Like vs. as** — Like governs nouns; as introduces clauses: "He thought as I did" not "like I did"

# Part 2: Structural Problems

## Uniform Sentence Length
AI writes sentences of similar length. Vary yours. Like this. Then write a longer one that flows differently and creates contrast. Short sentences punch. Longer ones let ideas breathe and develop naturally.

## Excessive Parallelism
Don't repeat "It's not X, it's Y" constructions. AI does this constantly:
- "It's not about speed—it's about precision."
- "It's not about quantity—it's about quality."
- "It's not about working harder—it's about working smarter."

One per piece, max.

## Negative Parallelisms
Watch for these constructions—AI overuses them to sound emphatic:
- "not just X, but also Y"
- "not only X, but Y"
- "This isn't just a tool—it's a revolution."

One per piece, max.

## List-Shaped Prose
Not everything needs bullet points. When explaining concepts, write in paragraphs with varied structure. Bullets are for quick reference, not for all communication.

## Em Dash Overuse
AI uses em dashes (—) frequently and perfectly. Humans use commas, parentheses, or just restructure sentences. If you see three em dashes in a paragraph, that's a red flag.

## Staccato Second-Person Pacing
This pattern reads as formulaic and preachy:

**Bad:**
> You're in a meeting. Someone mentions AI. You nod along. But inside, you're panicking.
>
> You get home. You open LinkedIn. You see another post about GPT.
>
> You feel behind. You feel lost. You wonder if it's too late.

**Problems:**
- Uniform short sentences
- Every paragraph starts with "You"
- Identical structure: Setup → "But" pivot → consequence

**Good:**
Instead, write like you're describing a situation you both recognize. Some sentences long, some short. Not every paragraph marching to the same beat.

## Loose Sentence Chains
Avoid stringing clauses with "and," "but," "which," "who"—this produces weak, monotonous prose. Use simple sentences, semicolons, and varied structures instead.

## Dangling Modifiers
Opening phrases must modify the grammatical subject.

**Bad:** "Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap."
**Good:** "Being in a dilapidated condition, the house was available very cheap."

---

# Part 3: Tone Problems

## Too Formal
Use contractions. "You'll find" not "You will find." "It's clear" not "It is clear." "We've seen" not "We have seen."

## Excessive Hedging
**Bad:** "It may be worth considering that perhaps we should think about..."
**Good:** Just say what you mean.

## Everything Emphasized Equally
If everything is "crucial" and "essential," nothing is. Reserve strong words for strong points. When everything screams, nothing gets heard.

## Relentless Positivity
Real humans express mixed feelings, frustration, and acknowledge downsides. Not everything is "exciting" and "invaluable." Sometimes things are hard, frustrating, or just okay.

**Bad:** "This incredible journey has been absolutely transformative!"
**Good:** "It took me 10 months to accept that AI prompt engineering just isn't relevant to my personal use."

## No Committed Opinions
Take a position. Don't seesaw between "on one hand... on the other hand" without landing somewhere. Readers want to know what you think.

---

# Part 4: Content Problems

## Abstract Instead of Concrete
**Bad:** "the profound impact of loss"
**Good:** "her empty chair at dinner"

**Bad:** "He demonstrated satisfaction with the outcome"
**Good:** "He grinned as he pocketed the coin"

**Bad:** "A period of unfavorable weather set in"
**Good:** "It rained every day for a week"

## Explaining Too Much
Leave room for subtext.

**Bad:** "He looked at the door, feeling a strong desire to leave the uncomfortable situation."
**Good:** "He looked at the door."

## Sensory Claims That Don't Track
AI strings together plausible-sounding descriptions that are subtly wrong. Check if your sensory details match actual experience. Would this really smell/sound/feel this way?

## Motion Without Progress
If a paragraph could be deleted without losing information, delete it. AI generates filler that sounds substantive but says nothing. Every sentence should earn its place.

## Unnecessary Title Case
AI capitalizes things that shouldn't be capitalized.

**Bad:** "Digital Transformation," "Customer Experience," "Thought Leadership"
**Good:** "digital transformation," "customer experience," "thought leadership"

Only proper nouns and actual product names get capitals.

## Avoid Emojis
Just avoid emojis. They make professional content look like AI-generated LinkedIn spam.

---

# Part 5: Elements of Style (Strunk & White)

## Use Active Voice
Direct and vigorous constructions outperform passive alternatives.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "will always be remembered by me" | "I shall always remember" |
| "Dead leaves lying on the ground" | "Dead leaves covered the ground" |
| "The meeting was attended by the team" | "The team attended the meeting" |

## Put Statements in Positive Form
Avoid weak, equivocal language.

| Negative | Positive |
|----------|----------|
| "He was not very often on time" | "He usually came late" |
| "not honest" | "dishonest" |
| "did not remember" | "forgot" |
| "did not pay attention" | "ignored" |

## Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language
Engage readers through precision.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "A period of unfavorable weather set in" | "It rained every day for a week" |
| "He showed satisfaction" | "He grinned as he pocketed the coin" |
| "The technology improved outcomes" | "Response times dropped from 3 hours to 20 minutes" |

## Omit Needless Words
Every sentence requires no superfluous words. Common redundancies to eliminate:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| "the question as to whether" | "whether" |
| "there is no doubt but that" | "no doubt" |
| "used for fuel purposes" | "used for fuel" |
| "His story is a strange one" | "His story is strange" |
| "in a hasty manner" | "hastily" |
| "owing to the fact that" | "since" |
| "in spite of the fact that" | "though" |
| "the fact that he had arrived" | "his arrival" |

Remove relative clauses when possible:
- "His brother, who is a member of the team" → "His brother, a member of the team"

## Keep Related Words Together
Position reveals relationships.

| Unclear | Clear |
|---------|-------|
| "There was a look in his eye" | "In his eye was a look" |
| "He only found two mistakes" | "He found only two mistakes" |

## Place Emphatic Words at the End
Reserve sentence conclusions for prominence.

**Weak:** "Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude, though it has advanced in many other ways."
**Strong:** "Humanity has advanced in many ways, but hardly in fortitude."

## Express Parallel Ideas in Parallel Form
Matching content demands matching structure.

**Bad:** "Formerly taught by textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed."
**Good:** "Formerly taught by textbook method; now by laboratory method."

## One Paragraph Per Topic
Begin with a topic sentence, end in harmony with the opening. Avoid trailing digressions.

# Part 6: LinkedIn Content Strategy

## The Coworker Test
Before posting, ask: **"Is what I'm posting insightful enough for someone to share with their coworker?"**

This is the threshold. If it doesn't pass, it's self-promotional noise.

## The 80/20 Rule
- **80% educational material:** Industry insights, frameworks, how-tos, playbooks
- **20% personal content:** Career stories, updates, behind-the-scenes

## Five Post Categories (First Three Get More Reach)
1. **Current events and industry trends** — React to news with your perspective
2. **Career storytelling** — Specific moments, not generic advice
3. **Guides, playbooks, and frameworks** — Practical, actionable content
4. **Behind-the-scenes content** — How you actually work
5. **Personal or career announcements** — Use sparingly

## Post Structure

### Hook (Under 200 Characters)
The first line must make people stop scrolling. Techniques:
- Datapoints that surprise
- Transformations (before/after)
- Predictions that challenge
- Striking analogies
- Personal admissions

### Body
- Tight paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Concrete examples, not abstractions
- Personal stories with specific details
- Industry-specific language your audience recognizes
- Skimmer-friendly formatting

### Formatting Tips
- Short paragraphs
- White space between ideas
- Occasional bold for emphasis (not everything)
- No walls of text

## Algorithm Basics
- Post 2-3 times weekly (minimum once weekly)
- Weekday mornings perform best
- Engage through comments on others' posts
- Consistency beats volume bursts
- Strong images enhance reach; poor ones diminish it
- Text-only posts work if nothing better suits the content

## The Core Philosophy
**"Give knowledge away for free, and expect nothing in return."**

---

# Part 7: Hooks That Work

The best hooks feel like you're telling a friend something interesting, or giving them an inside peek at how you figured something out.

**Critical insight: "How I" is better than "How to."**

Role models: Wes Kao, Ethan Mollick, Teresa Torres—not sensationalist, just smart trusted humans sharing thoughts as they figure things out.

---

## Category 1: Personal Discovery Hooks

These share a real process of figuring something out:

- I wanted AI to know the user flow of an app. What worked best was a Loom walkthrough → uploading the video to Gemini → context for AI.

- It took me 10 months to accept that AI prompt engineering is just not relevant to my personal use.

- When I ask an engineer to explain a technical concept, I usually end up more confused. LLMs can do what few humans can: explain from the ground up.

- I've found that using AI for personal projects with low stakes builds much better intuition for "what's easy and hard" than any professional training.

- Claude hallucinated so badly when I asked for customer exact quotes from interview transcripts. Finally I fixed it:

- Hebrew is my first language, but I read very slowly. I started regularly asking Perplexity to "use Hebrew sources, but answer in English."

- As of this week, Claude Code is coaching me on my tasks as a PM. As of today, it's even creating them for me.

- I don't want to become a prompting expert, so I started reverse-engineering conversations where I've already given AI a lot of feedback.

- Most team knowledge isn't found in a deck or document, so my favorite way to give AI context is to have it interview me with this prompt:

- Wrapping my mind around the difference between Claude Code and Cursor:

---

## Category 2: Honest Admission Hooks

These acknowledge struggle, failure, or changed minds:

- Before LLMs, if people asked me "should PMs be technical?" I gave a polite answer. Now it's 2025 and I'm not gonna be polite:

- To every PM who feels behind on AI: no, you didn't miss the boat. Here's my embarrassing story of not-using-AI-at-work.

- I failed to make a web app on both Replit & Lovable (and I code). I still think every PM should try this at least once:

- If you're finding it hard to get an AI agent working, you're not alone. I ran a usability test with 5 AI-forward PMs and they all had a hard time.

- I've been admittedly slow warming up to AI prototyping. Here's what you all shared that helped me place when it's the right tool:

- Influencers love heralding AI agents—but have you tried making one? Here's how I got a taste of reality:

- I showed my CEO my 90 day plan. And he said try again.

---

## Category 3: Counterintuitive Insight Hooks

These challenge common beliefs:

- The most intelligent people I know aren't the most effective. I think about this a lot as I use Claude Opus and ChatGPT-5.

- There's a popular saying that "'no' is a complete sentence," and I would categorize this under "advice that sounds good in theory but is dangerous in practice."

- We all love the phrase "done is better than perfect." It's a great way to prevent analysis paralysis, but there's a dark side:

- Social headlines make it seem cohort-based courses are in the toilet. Yet Maven's instructors have 2x'ed their earnings in the last 12 months. What is going on?

- Every startup should incorporate the [invent a name] rule internally.

- Why my old LinkedIn posts stopped working

---

## Category 4: Real Experience Hooks (Data & Credibility)

These lead with specific numbers or credentials:

- In our new paper we ran an experiment at Procter and Gamble with 776 experienced professionals solving real business problems.

- Over the past 5 years I've mentored close to 500 designers in 1:1 calls. Most of them struggle with the same 3 things—and they have nothing to do with design:

- Nearing 4,000 PMs signed up for today's free lightning lesson, "Cursor isn't just for coding."

- Last week I ran 8 customer interviews, but I know my memory is selective. Here's how I use AI to tackle that bias:

- I enrolled in Aman Khan's AI PM course without telling him. I'm gonna use it for a side project I want to take from prototype to production.

---

## Category 5: Pattern Recognition Hooks

These identify something you've noticed repeatedly:

- I've noticed junior folks often avoid sharing a point of view because they are less experienced, and feel less confident. Here's the thing though:

- In my experience, one of the simplest and best ways to learn on the job is by straight-up observing people. I've done this for the past several years and anyone can do it.

- We will always have too much on our plate. My solution for this used to be simple: brute force.

- Went to Hubspot Inbound. And when I looked at most of the booths, I just saw dollars in trash cans.

- Most European startups who want to go to the US fail.

---

## Category 6: Project Announcement Hooks

These share what you're building/trying in real-time:

- My project for today: can I use AI to get 10x faster at creating tutorial videos?

- My project for tonight after putting the kids to bed: can I build an AI agent that will automatically refresh our blog posts?

- I'm excited: I'm starting a side project with two former co-workers. We're running all of it in Cursor (product, eng, marketing), synced with Github.

- Cofounder: "Tal we should run user interviews." Me: "I'll feed Cursor 1) the product strategy doc and ask it to 2) draft a user research document, with 3) questions based on 'The Mom Test'. I'll push it to Github so you can review."

- Saving my notes on what worked and didn't work so far with Perplexity Comet browser:

- If my CEO stopped everything and threw a 3-day AI hackathon to try new AI tools, here's what I'd do:

---

## Category 7: "Cursor Isn't Just for Coding" Hooks

Specifically for non-code AI tool use:

- Cursor isn't just for coding. Here's how I used it to poke holes in my (plain english) PRD and generate a (plain english) user research plan.

- Cursor isn't just for coding. Big Tech PMs are using it to build their PM AI copilots (a product thinking partner in plain English, not code).

- The freaking coolest part of 2025 is that someone can share an entire product in a 300 word LinkedIn post (yep, the product is *in* the post).

- For PMs who want to use AI agents to be more productive but feel stuck coming up with ideas, I've been experimenting with a prompt:

- In my last week at Riverside I showed a junior PM how to write their first PRD by talking out loud to ChatGPT

---

## Category 8: Dramatic Story Hooks

These tease a specific memorable incident:

- After a VP publicly attacked me in an 11-person meeting, I discovered the Chihuahua Method:

- The biggest mistake I made in my career was... Here's what I learned.

- The moment I knew I had to change my approach to [topic] was when...

- I once lost a major client because... Here's how I turned it around.

---

## Category 9: Spiky Point of View Hooks (Maven Framework)

These take a strong, debatable stance:

- What blocks a lot of [topic] is the belief that...

- There's a false belief that...

- Contrary to what you've been told...

- A common misconception is that...

- Counterintuitive lesson I've learned running multiple product teams at the same time as an IC:

- An underappreciated part of [product creativity]...

- I have a lot of product pet peeves, but my biggest one is talking to PMs who...

- People talk about how [X is going to happen]. I don't think so.

---

## Hook Templates (Fill in the Blanks)

**Industry Insider:**
- Everyone in [industry] thinks [common belief]. But here's what I've learned after years on the inside...

**Changed Mind:**
- I used to believe [common misconception]. Then I realized...

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Behind the scenes at [company/industry], there's one thing nobody talks about...

**Failure to Lesson:**
- The biggest mistake I made in my career was [describe mistake]. Here's what I learned...
- The biggest thing holding people back when using AI is...

**Pivotal Moment:**
- The moment I knew I had to change my approach to [topic] was when...

**Recovery Story:**
- I once [lost a major client/lost a team's trust/got fired] because [mistake]. Here's how I turned it around...

**Zero Budget:**
- How I'd [achieve goal], if I had $0 for [resource]:

# Part 8: Calls to Action That Work

## Principles
- Don't beg for engagement ("Like if you agree!")
- Offer genuine value
- Be specific about what they'll get
- Social proof helps but isn't required

## Good Examples

**Course/Program:**
- "Join 900+ alumni who've launched their own courses."
- "Third cohort starts next month—limited spots."
- "We run this 2-3 times per year."

**Newsletter:**
- "I write about [specific topic] at [url]"
- "If you want more practical insights like this, I share them weekly at [url]"

**Engagement (Subtle):**
- "If you've tried this, I'd love to hear what worked for you."
- "What's your experience been?"
- End with a genuine question related to the content

**Waitlist:**
- "If you want to teach what you know, we're opening applications for [program]."

# Part 10: Workflows

## Writing New Content

1. **Start with the core insight.** What do you actually want to say? Write it in one sentence.

2. **Choose a hook format.** Pick from the categories above based on what fits your insight.

3. **Write conversationally.** First draft should sound like you're telling a colleague. Use your actual words.

4. **Add concrete details.** Replace every abstraction with a specific example.

5. **Run the checklist.** Go through Part 9 systematically.

6. **Read aloud.** If it sounds stiff, rewrite. If you wouldn't say it that way, change it.

7. **Cut 20%.** First drafts are always too long. Remove the weakest sentences.

## Reviewing Existing Content

1. **Scan for banned words and phrases.** Use Ctrl+F for the obvious ones.

2. **Check structural patterns.** Count parallelisms, em dashes, sentence lengths.

3. **Verify concrete examples exist.** If it's all abstract, flag it.

4. **Test the hook.** Does it make you want to read more? Be honest.

5. **Check the voice.** Is it first-person and conversational, or second-person and preachy?

6. **Confirm clear opinion.** Does the piece land somewhere, or does it hedge?

7. **Suggest specific rewrites.** Don't just flag problems—show the fix.
