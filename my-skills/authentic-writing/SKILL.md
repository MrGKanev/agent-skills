# Authentic Writing

Write like a human sharing insights with a friend. This skill helps you create content that doesn't sound like it was generated by AI, and reviews existing content for authenticity markers.

## Core Philosophy

The goal isn't to trick people—it's to write content that's actually good. AI writing fails because it optimizes for sounding smart rather than communicating clearly. Real writing has rough edges, strong opinions, and personality.

**Write like you talk.** Test each sentence by asking: would you phrase it this way in conversation with a friend? If not, rewrite it. Prioritize raw, original phrasing from how you'd naturally say something over polished rewrites.

**First-person over second-person.** Share your experiences using "I" instead of prescriptive "you must" or "you should." This lets readers decide what applies to them. Instead of "The AI wall of text might overwhelm you," write "When I say 'ask me one question at a time' I'm giving AI a chance to align and recalibrate."

# Part 1: What to Avoid

## Words to Never Use

These words scream "AI wrote this":

```
delve, tapestry, realm, foster, landscape, leverage, robust, seamless,
navigate, journey, embark, multifaceted, nuanced, comprehensive,
intricate, pivotal, paramount, crucial, underscore, showcase, illuminate,
unveil, harness, elevate, unlock, streamline, optimize, cutting-edge,
groundbreaking, game-changer, testament, meticulous, unwavering,
invaluable, vibrant, dynamic, innovative, notably, particularly
```

## Phrases to Never Use

```
"In today's fast-paced world..."
"In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
"In this digital age..."
"Navigating the complexities of..."
"Let's delve into..."
"It's important to note that..."
"It's worth mentioning that..."
"A testament to..."
"At its core..."
"This underscores the importance of..."
"Based on the information provided..."
"I hope this email finds you well"
"In conclusion..."
"Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"
"Looking ahead..."
"As we move forward..."
"The future of X remains..."
"Despite these challenges..."
"What does this mean for the future of..."
```

## Replace Latinate Words with Simple Alternatives

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| utilize | use |
| facilitate | help |
| demonstrate | show |
| implement | do, start, run |
| leverage | use |
| commence | start |
| terminate | end |
| endeavor | try |
| ascertain | find out |
| subsequently | then, later |
| prioritize | focus on |
| optimize | improve |
| synergize | work together |
| incentivize | encourage |
| conceptualize | think about |

## Words to Eliminate or Revise (Strunk & White)

### "Case, character, nature"
Usually filler. "Many rooms were poorly ventilated" replaces "In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated."

### "Factor, feature"
Hackneyed terms. "He won by being better trained" beats "His superior training was the great factor."

### "Interesting"
Don't announce—demonstrate. Present the content directly.

### "Very"
Employ sparingly. Choose inherently powerful vocabulary instead.

### "However"
Avoid leading with it for "nevertheless": "At last, however, we succeeded" rather than "However, we at last succeeded."

### "One of the most"
Avoid this tired opening. State your point directly instead.

### Common Confusions
- **Different than** vs. **different from** — Use "from" exclusively
- **Less vs. fewer** — Less modifies quantity; fewer modifies countable number: "fewer men" not "less men"
- **Like vs. as** — Like governs nouns; as introduces clauses: "He thought as I did" not "like I did"

# Part 2: Structural Problems

## Uniform Sentence Length
AI writes sentences of similar length. Vary yours. Like this. Then write a longer one that flows differently and creates contrast. Short sentences punch. Longer ones let ideas breathe and develop naturally.

## Excessive Parallelism
Don't repeat "It's not X, it's Y" constructions. AI does this constantly:
- "It's not about speed—it's about precision."
- "It's not about quantity—it's about quality."
- "It's not about working harder—it's about working smarter."

One per piece, max.

## Negative Parallelisms
Watch for these constructions—AI overuses them to sound emphatic:
- "not just X, but also Y"
- "not only X, but Y"
- "This isn't just a tool—it's a revolution."

One per piece, max.

## List-Shaped Prose
Not everything needs bullet points. When explaining concepts, write in paragraphs with varied structure. Bullets are for quick reference, not for all communication.

## Em Dash Overuse
AI uses em dashes (—) frequently and perfectly. Humans use commas, parentheses, or just restructure sentences. If you see three em dashes in a paragraph, that's a red flag.

## Staccato Second-Person Pacing
This pattern reads as formulaic and preachy:

**Bad:**
> You're in a meeting. Someone mentions AI. You nod along. But inside, you're panicking.
>
> You get home. You open LinkedIn. You see another post about GPT.
>
> You feel behind. You feel lost. You wonder if it's too late.

**Problems:**
- Uniform short sentences
- Every paragraph starts with "You"
- Identical structure: Setup → "But" pivot → consequence

**Good:**
Instead, write like you're describing a situation you both recognize. Some sentences long, some short. Not every paragraph marching to the same beat.

## Loose Sentence Chains
Avoid stringing clauses with "and," "but," "which," "who"—this produces weak, monotonous prose. Use simple sentences, semicolons, and varied structures instead.

## Dangling Modifiers
Opening phrases must modify the grammatical subject.

**Bad:** "Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap."
**Good:** "Being in a dilapidated condition, the house was available very cheap."

---

# Part 3: Tone Problems

## Too Formal
Use contractions. "You'll find" not "You will find." "It's clear" not "It is clear." "We've seen" not "We have seen."

## Excessive Hedging
**Bad:** "It may be worth considering that perhaps we should think about..."
**Good:** Just say what you mean.

## Everything Emphasized Equally
If everything is "crucial" and "essential," nothing is. Reserve strong words for strong points. When everything screams, nothing gets heard.

## Relentless Positivity
Real humans express mixed feelings, frustration, and acknowledge downsides. Not everything is "exciting" and "invaluable." Sometimes things are hard, frustrating, or just okay.

**Bad:** "This incredible journey has been absolutely transformative!"
**Good:** "It took me 10 months to accept that AI prompt engineering just isn't relevant to my personal use."

## No Committed Opinions
Take a position. Don't seesaw between "on one hand... on the other hand" without landing somewhere. Readers want to know what you think.

---

# Part 4: Content Problems

## Abstract Instead of Concrete
**Bad:** "the profound impact of loss"
**Good:** "her empty chair at dinner"

**Bad:** "He demonstrated satisfaction with the outcome"
**Good:** "He grinned as he pocketed the coin"

**Bad:** "A period of unfavorable weather set in"
**Good:** "It rained every day for a week"

## Explaining Too Much
Leave room for subtext.

**Bad:** "He looked at the door, feeling a strong desire to leave the uncomfortable situation."
**Good:** "He looked at the door."

## Sensory Claims That Don't Track
AI strings together plausible-sounding descriptions that are subtly wrong. Check if your sensory details match actual experience. Would this really smell/sound/feel this way?

## Motion Without Progress
If a paragraph could be deleted without losing information, delete it. AI generates filler that sounds substantive but says nothing. Every sentence should earn its place.

## Unnecessary Title Case
AI capitalizes things that shouldn't be capitalized.

**Bad:** "Digital Transformation," "Customer Experience," "Thought Leadership"
**Good:** "digital transformation," "customer experience," "thought leadership"

Only proper nouns and actual product names get capitals.

## Avoid Emojis
Just avoid emojis. They make professional content look like AI-generated LinkedIn spam.

---

# Part 5: Elements of Style (Strunk & White)

## Use Active Voice
Direct and vigorous constructions outperform passive alternatives.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "will always be remembered by me" | "I shall always remember" |
| "Dead leaves lying on the ground" | "Dead leaves covered the ground" |
| "The meeting was attended by the team" | "The team attended the meeting" |

## Put Statements in Positive Form
Avoid weak, equivocal language.

| Negative | Positive |
|----------|----------|
| "He was not very often on time" | "He usually came late" |
| "not honest" | "dishonest" |
| "did not remember" | "forgot" |
| "did not pay attention" | "ignored" |

## Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language
Engage readers through precision.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "A period of unfavorable weather set in" | "It rained every day for a week" |
| "He showed satisfaction" | "He grinned as he pocketed the coin" |
| "The technology improved outcomes" | "Response times dropped from 3 hours to 20 minutes" |

## Omit Needless Words
Every sentence requires no superfluous words. Common redundancies to eliminate:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| "the question as to whether" | "whether" |
| "there is no doubt but that" | "no doubt" |
| "used for fuel purposes" | "used for fuel" |
| "His story is a strange one" | "His story is strange" |
| "in a hasty manner" | "hastily" |
| "owing to the fact that" | "since" |
| "in spite of the fact that" | "though" |
| "the fact that he had arrived" | "his arrival" |

Remove relative clauses when possible:
- "His brother, who is a member of the team" → "His brother, a member of the team"

## Keep Related Words Together
Position reveals relationships.

| Unclear | Clear |
|---------|-------|
| "There was a look in his eye" | "In his eye was a look" |
| "He only found two mistakes" | "He found only two mistakes" |

## Place Emphatic Words at the End
Reserve sentence conclusions for prominence.

**Weak:** "Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude, though it has advanced in many other ways."
**Strong:** "Humanity has advanced in many ways, but hardly in fortitude."

## Express Parallel Ideas in Parallel Form
Matching content demands matching structure.

**Bad:** "Formerly taught by textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed."
**Good:** "Formerly taught by textbook method; now by laboratory method."

## One Paragraph Per Topic
Begin with a topic sentence, end in harmony with the opening. Avoid trailing digressions.

# Part 6: LinkedIn Content Strategy

## The Coworker Test
Before posting, ask: **"Is what I'm posting insightful enough for someone to share with their coworker?"**

This is the threshold. If it doesn't pass, it's self-promotional noise.

## The 80/20 Rule
- **80% educational material:** Industry insights, frameworks, how-tos, playbooks
- **20% personal content:** Career stories, updates, behind-the-scenes

## Five Post Categories (First Three Get More Reach)
1. **Current events and industry trends** — React to news with your perspective
2. **Career storytelling** — Specific moments, not generic advice
3. **Guides, playbooks, and frameworks** — Practical, actionable content
4. **Behind-the-scenes content** — How you actually work
5. **Personal or career announcements** — Use sparingly

## Post Structure

### Hook (Under 200 Characters)
The first line must make people stop scrolling. Techniques:
- Datapoints that surprise
- Transformations (before/after)
- Predictions that challenge
- Striking analogies
- Personal admissions

### Body
- Tight paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Concrete examples, not abstractions
- Personal stories with specific details
- Industry-specific language your audience recognizes
- Skimmer-friendly formatting

### Formatting Tips
- Short paragraphs
- White space between ideas
- Occasional bold for emphasis (not everything)
- No walls of text

## Algorithm Basics
- Post 2-3 times weekly (minimum once weekly)
- Weekday mornings perform best
- Engage through comments on others' posts
- Consistency beats volume bursts
- Strong images enhance reach; poor ones diminish it
- Text-only posts work if nothing better suits the content

## The Core Philosophy
**"Give knowledge away for free, and expect nothing in return."**

---

## Hook Templates (Fill in the Blanks)

**Industry Insider:**
- Everyone in [industry] thinks [common belief]. But here's what I've learned after years on the inside...

**Changed Mind:**
- I used to believe [common misconception]. Then I realized...

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Behind the scenes at [company/industry], there's one thing nobody talks about...

**Failure to Lesson:**
- The biggest mistake I made in my career was [describe mistake]. Here's what I learned...
- The biggest thing holding people back when using AI is...

**Pivotal Moment:**
- The moment I knew I had to change my approach to [topic] was when...

**Recovery Story:**
- I once [lost a major client/lost a team's trust/got fired] because [mistake]. Here's how I turned it around...

**Zero Budget:**
- How I'd [achieve goal], if I had $0 for [resource]:

# Part 8: Calls to Action That Work

## Principles
- Don't beg for engagement ("Like if you agree!")
- Offer genuine value
- Be specific about what they'll get
- Social proof helps but isn't required

## Good Examples

**Course/Program:**
- "Join 900+ alumni who've launched their own courses."
- "Third cohort starts next month—limited spots."
- "We run this 2-3 times per year."

**Newsletter:**
- "I write about [specific topic] at [url]"
- "If you want more practical insights like this, I share them weekly at [url]"

**Engagement (Subtle):**
- "If you've tried this, I'd love to hear what worked for you."
- "What's your experience been?"
- End with a genuine question related to the content

**Waitlist:**
- "If you want to teach what you know, we're opening applications for [program]."

# Part 10: Workflows

## Writing New Content

1. **Start with the core insight.** What do you actually want to say? Write it in one sentence.

2. **Choose a hook format.** Pick from the categories above based on what fits your insight.

3. **Write conversationally.** First draft should sound like you're telling a colleague. Use your actual words.

4. **Add concrete details.** Replace every abstraction with a specific example.

5. **Run the checklist.** Go through Part 9 systematically.

6. **Read aloud.** If it sounds stiff, rewrite. If you wouldn't say it that way, change it.

7. **Cut 20%.** First drafts are always too long. Remove the weakest sentences.

## Reviewing Existing Content

1. **Scan for banned words and phrases.** Use Ctrl+F for the obvious ones.

2. **Check structural patterns.** Count parallelisms, em dashes, sentence lengths.

3. **Verify concrete examples exist.** If it's all abstract, flag it.

4. **Test the hook.** Does it make you want to read more? Be honest.

5. **Check the voice.** Is it first-person and conversational, or second-person and preachy?

6. **Confirm clear opinion.** Does the piece land somewhere, or does it hedge?

7. **Suggest specific rewrites.** Don't just flag problems—show the fix.

# Part 11: Advanced AI Detection Patterns

These are subtler signs that content was AI-generated. Experienced readers catch these instantly.

## The "Comprehensive Coverage" Problem

AI tries to cover every angle. Humans focus on what they actually care about.

**AI pattern:** "There are several factors to consider: cost, time, quality, scalability, maintainability, and user experience."

**Human pattern:** "The real issue is time. Everything else is negotiable."

Humans are opinionated and selective. AI is thorough and balanced.

## The "Smooth Transition" Tell

AI loves transitional phrases that sound professional but add nothing:

```
"Building on this foundation..."
"With this in mind..."
"Taking this a step further..."
"This brings us to..."
"Turning our attention to..."
"Having established this..."
"This naturally leads to..."
```

Real writing often jumps. New paragraph, new idea. No hand-holding.

## The "Perfect Structure" Problem

AI produces suspiciously well-organized content:
- Exactly 3 points (not 2 or 4)
- Each point roughly the same length
- Neat intro → body → conclusion
- Every section wraps up tidily

Human writing is messier. Sometimes you have 7 points. Sometimes your conclusion is one sentence. Sometimes you trail off because the idea is still forming.

## The "Enthusiastic Agreement" Pattern

AI tends to validate before adding:

```
"That's a great question!"
"You raise an excellent point."
"This is such an important topic."
"Absolutely, and..."
```

Humans just answer. Or disagree. Or say "I don't know."

## The "Rhetorical Question Setup"

AI loves rhetorical questions as transitions:

```
"But what does this really mean?"
"So how do we solve this?"
"Why does this matter?"
"What's the takeaway here?"
```

One rhetorical question is fine. Three in a piece is a pattern.

## The "Bullet Point Symmetry" Tell

AI makes bullet points suspiciously parallel:

**AI:**
- Define your goals clearly
- Measure your progress regularly
- Adjust your approach accordingly
- Celebrate your wins consistently

**Human:**
- Know what you want
- Track it somehow
- Change course when it's not working
- (Sometimes I forget to celebrate, honestly)

Notice: AI bullets are the same length, same grammatical structure, same rhythm. Humans vary.

## The "Hedged Certainty" Contradiction

AI hedges even when being emphatic:

```
"This is arguably one of the most important..."
"It's fair to say that this could potentially..."
"In many ways, this tends to be..."
```

Either commit or don't. "Arguably one of the most important" is trying to sound confident while covering for uncertainty.

## The "Exhaustive List" Tell

AI can't resist completeness:

**AI:** "Consider factors like budget, timeline, team capacity, technical requirements, stakeholder alignment, risk tolerance, and market conditions."

**Human:** "It comes down to budget and timeline. Everything else follows."

Humans prioritize ruthlessly. AI lists comprehensively.

## The "Metaphor Explanation" Pattern

AI explains its metaphors instead of letting them land:

**AI:** "Think of it like a garden—you need to plant seeds (your ideas), water them regularly (consistent effort), and be patient for growth (long-term results)."

**Human:** "Treat it like a garden. Plant, water, wait."

If you have to explain the metaphor in parentheses, it's not working.

## The "Both Sides" Compulsion

AI is allergic to strong opinions:

```
"While some argue X, others believe Y. Both perspectives have merit."
"There are valid points on both sides of this debate."
"It's important to consider multiple viewpoints here."
```

Real thought leadership picks a side. You can acknowledge complexity without being wishy-washy.

# Part 13: Storytelling Structures That Work

## The "Aha Moment" Structure

1. **Setup:** What you believed/did before
2. **Trigger:** The specific moment something changed
3. **Realization:** What you now understand
4. **Application:** How this changes your behavior

**Example:**
> For years I thought networking meant collecting business cards. Then I went to a conference where I talked to exactly one person for two hours. We're still collaborating three years later. Now I optimize for depth, not breadth.

## The "Mistake → Lesson" Structure

1. **The mistake:** Be specific. What exactly went wrong?
2. **The consequence:** What happened as a result?
3. **The insight:** What did you learn?
4. **The change:** What do you do differently now?

**Example:**
> I once sent a proposal without proofreading it. The client's name was misspelled in the subject line. They didn't respond. Now I have a 24-hour rule: nothing important goes out the same day I write it.

## The "Tension → Resolution" Structure

1. **Establish stakes:** Why does this matter?
2. **Create tension:** What's the conflict/problem/challenge?
3. **Show struggle:** What did you try? What didn't work?
4. **Resolve:** How did it end?
5. **Extract meaning:** What's the takeaway?

## The "Before/After" Structure

1. **Before:** Paint the old state vividly
2. **The change:** What intervention happened?
3. **After:** Show the new reality with equal specificity
4. **Why it worked:** Brief explanation

**Example:**
> Before: I spent 3 hours every Monday planning my week. By Wednesday, the plan was useless.
> Change: I switched to daily 15-minute planning.
> After: I actually finish what I start. My weeks feel less chaotic.
> Why: Daily planning adapts to reality. Weekly planning fights it.

## The "Conversation" Structure

Present an insight through dialogue:

> Coworker: "How do you get so much done?"
> Me: "I don't check email before noon."
> Coworker: "But what about urgent stuff?"
> Me: "Almost nothing is actually urgent."

This format feels human because it is human—it's how ideas actually spread.

## The "List of Specifics" Structure

Skip the setup. Just give concrete examples:

> Things I've learned about remote work:
> - The video call could've been a Loom
> - The Loom could've been a Slack message
> - The Slack message could've been nothing
> - Most "quick syncs" are procrastination for both parties

No introduction needed. The specificity IS the insight.

# Part 14: Voice Development

## Finding Your Voice

Your voice emerges from constraints, not freedom. Ask yourself:

**What do you NEVER say?**
- I never use sports metaphors
- I never say "leverage"
- I never pretend to have answers I don't have

**What do you ALWAYS say?**
- I always use specific numbers
- I always admit when I'm uncertain
- I always include one self-deprecating moment

**What's your sentence rhythm?**
- Do you write long, flowing sentences with multiple clauses?
- Or short. Punchy. Direct.
- Or a deliberate mix?

**What's your relationship to the reader?**
- Peer sharing discoveries?
- Expert teaching?
- Outsider questioning?
- Friend venting?

## Voice Consistency Checks

Read your last 10 pieces. Look for:
- Do you have verbal tics? (Words you overuse)
- Do your openers have a pattern?
- Do your conclusions have a pattern?
- Is there a consistent emotional register?

Inconsistency isn't necessarily bad—but it should be intentional.

## Authentic vs. Performed Authenticity

**Authentic:** "I've been thinking about this and I'm not sure I'm right."

**Performed authenticity:** "I'll be vulnerable here and admit that I've been thinking about this, and honestly? I'm not sure I'm right. And that's okay."

The second adds nothing but performative markers of authenticity. Real authenticity doesn't announce itself.

## Voice Killers

Things that flatten voice:
- Over-editing until all personality is gone
- Copying someone else's style wholesale
- Writing for an imagined "professional" audience
- Removing all opinions to avoid controversy
- Adding caveats to every statement

# Part 15: Psychology of Engagement

## Why People Stop Scrolling

1. **Pattern interrupt:** Something unexpected breaks the feed monotony
2. **Self-recognition:** "That's me" or "I've felt this"
3. **Curiosity gap:** You've opened a loop they need closed
4. **Tribal signal:** Content signals "I'm one of you"
5. **Status insight:** Information that could make them look smart

## Why People Keep Reading

1. **Progressive revelation:** Each paragraph reveals something new
2. **Emotional investment:** They're curious how it ends
3. **Practical value:** They're getting something useful
4. **Entertainment:** It's genuinely enjoyable to read
5. **Validation:** You're articulating something they've felt

## Why People Share

1. **Identity signal:** "This is who I am"
2. **Social currency:** Makes them look informed/smart
3. **Genuine helpfulness:** They think others need this
4. **Conversation starter:** It'll spark discussion
5. **Emotional resonance:** "I needed to share this feeling"

## Why People Comment

1. **Add their experience:** "This happened to me too"
2. **Disagree publicly:** Status move, shows critical thinking
3. **Ask questions:** Genuine curiosity
4. **Tag someone:** "You need to see this"
5. **Get visibility:** Comments on popular posts get seen

Understanding these motivations helps you craft content that serves them genuinely—not manipulatively.

# Part 16: Platform-Specific Tips

## LinkedIn

- First line is everything—it's the only thing visible before "see more"
- Avoid hashtags in the body (put at end if needed)
- Native document posts (carousels) currently get high reach
- Comments in first hour matter most
- Long-form (1000+ words) can work if genuinely valuable
- Video is underutilized and gets reach

## Twitter/X

- First line carries even more weight (no "see more")
- Threads > single tweets for complex ideas
- Number your thread posts (1/7, 2/7, etc.)
- The thread opener is the whole game
- Quote tweets with your take outperform plain retweets
- Controversy gets reach but burns reputation

## Blogs/Newsletters

- Subject lines are your hook
- First paragraph must earn the second
- Subheads let skimmers find value
- One clear idea per post beats comprehensive coverage
- Consistency matters more than frequency
- Direct "you" works better here than on LinkedIn

## General Cross-Platform

- Content that works is content that works—core principles transfer
- Reformatting is underrated: one insight = one tweet + one LinkedIn post + one newsletter section
- Your voice should be consistent across platforms
- But your format should adapt to each

# Part 17: Editing Techniques

## The "Out Loud" Test

Read your piece out loud. Every time you:
- Stumble over words → simplify
- Feel like you're lecturing → warm it up
- Get bored → cut or rewrite
- Cringe → definitely cut

If you can't read it naturally, they can't read it naturally.

## The "So What?" Test

After every paragraph, ask: "So what? Why does this matter?"

If you can't answer, the paragraph doesn't earn its place.

## The "One Friend" Test

Imagine sending this to one specific friend. Not "your audience"—one person.

Would they read it? Would they reply? What would they say?

This prevents writing for an abstract audience and keeps you human.

## The "Cut 20%" Rule

Your first draft is too long. It always is.

Find the weakest 20% and delete it. The piece will be stronger.

If you can't find 20% to cut, you're not looking hard enough.

## The "Rearrangement" Test

Try putting your conclusion at the beginning. Often, the real hook is buried in paragraph 4.

AI writes in order: intro → body → conclusion.
Humans can start anywhere: conclusion → context → nuance.

## The "Screenshot" Test

Take a screenshot of your post as it would appear in the feed.

- Can you see the hook?
- Does it look like a wall of text?
- Is there enough white space?
- Would YOU click "see more"?

# Part 18: More Hook Examples

## The "Number + Surprising Context" Hook

- 73% of my best ideas come from conversations I wasn't supposed to be in.
- I've sent 2,847 cold emails. 11 of them changed my career.

- Successful people are just people who didn't quit.

## The "Time-Specific" Hook

# Part 19: Common Mistakes

## The "Trying to Go Viral" Mistake

Content optimized for virality sounds like content optimized for virality. Readers can smell it.

Better: Write for 100 people who really care than 10,000 who scroll past.

## The "Expert Performance" Mistake

Pretending to know more than you do. Readers detect this instantly.

Better: Share what you're learning, not what you've mastered.

## The "Me Me Me" Mistake

Every post is about your achievements, your insights, your journey.

Better: Make the reader the hero. Your experience serves their growth.

## The "Template Following" Mistake

Hooks that follow obvious templates ("X things I learned about Y") feel generic.

Better: Use structures as starting points, then break them.

## The "Engagement Bait" Mistake

"Agree?" "Thoughts?" "Like if this resonated!"

Better: Content so good people engage without being asked.

## The "Over-Polishing" Mistake

Editing until all personality is gone. Every sentence perfect, total effect lifeless.

Better: Leave some rough edges. Imperfection signals humanity.

## The "Solving Everything" Mistake

Trying to comprehensively address a topic in one post.

Better: Go deep on one specific angle. Leave things out.

## The "Fear of Repetition" Mistake

Thinking you can only say something once.

Better: Your core ideas should appear repeatedly, from different angles.

# Part 20: Before/After Rewrites

## Example 1: Corporate → Human

**Before:**
> In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, organizations must leverage innovative strategies to navigate complex challenges and drive sustainable growth. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement and embracing transformative technologies, companies can unlock unprecedented opportunities for success.

**After:**
> Most companies say they want innovation. What they actually want is predictable results with minimal risk. That's not innovation—that's optimization wearing a costume.

## Example 2: Abstract → Concrete

**Before:**
> Effective communication is essential for leadership success. Leaders who communicate well build trust and inspire their teams to achieve great things.

**After:**
> My best boss sent one email per day, max. No fluff, no corporate speak. Just: "Here's what's happening. Here's what I need. Questions?" I'd run through walls for her.

## Example 3: Lecturing → Sharing

**Before:**
> You need to understand that building habits requires consistency. You must commit to showing up every day, even when you don't feel like it. You have to push through resistance and trust the process.

**After:**
> I've tried to build a writing habit for five years. I've failed probably thirty times. What finally worked wasn't discipline—it was making it so easy I couldn't say no. 100 words. That's it. Most days I write more, but 100 is the bar.

## Example 4: List → Story

**Before:**
> Benefits of morning routines:
> - Increased productivity
> - Better mental clarity
> - More energy throughout the day
> - Improved focus
> - Reduced stress

**After:**
> Six months ago, my mornings were chaos. Wake up late, check email in bed, rush to meetings feeling behind before 9am. Now I wake up at 6, don't touch my phone for an hour, and write before the world can interrupt. The difference isn't productivity—it's that I finally feel like I'm driving my day instead of being dragged through it.

## Example 5: Vague → Specific

**Before:**
> I learned a lot from my mentor about leadership and life.

**After:**
> My mentor once told me: "Never send an email angry. Write it, then delete it. Write it again tomorrow." I've ignored this advice three times. Each time was a disaster.

## Example 6: AI Summary → Human Insight

**Before:**
> Remote work offers many advantages, including flexibility, reduced commute time, and improved work-life balance. However, it also presents challenges such as communication difficulties, feelings of isolation, and the blurring of professional and personal boundaries.

**After:**
> Remote work is great until you realize you haven't spoken to another human in three days and your "commute" is a 10-step walk to a desk covered in coffee rings. The freedom is real. So is the loneliness.

# Part 21: The Authenticity Spectrum

Not all content needs to be deeply personal. Here's a spectrum:

## Level 1: Curated Information
Sharing useful information with your perspective.
- "Here's a framework I use..."
- "Three tools that helped me..."
- Lower authenticity required, but still needs your angle.

## Level 2: Professional Insight
Observations from your work experience.
- "After 10 years in this field..."
- "What I've noticed in my clients..."
- Medium authenticity, needs specific examples.

## Level 3: Personal Experience
Stories from your actual life.
- "Last month I faced..."
- "My biggest failure was..."
- Higher authenticity, needs vulnerability.

## Level 4: Real-Time Reflection
Thoughts you're still processing.
- "I'm currently struggling with..."
- "I don't know the answer yet, but..."
- Highest authenticity, requires genuine uncertainty.

Each level is valid. Match the level to your comfort and the content's purpose.

# Appendix: Self-Diagnostic Questions

Use these to evaluate your own writing:

1. If I removed my name, would anyone know I wrote this?
2. Is there a single sentence only I could have written?
3. Did I learn something while writing this, or just transcribe what I already knew?
4. Would I send this to someone I respect?
5. Does this contain at least one specific detail (name, number, date, place)?
6. Am I taking a position someone might disagree with?
7. If I read this in a year, will I still stand by it?
8. Is there any sentence I'd be embarrassed to read out loud?
9. Did I write this because I had something to say, or because I "should" post something?
10. Does this sound like me talking, or me performing?

If you can't answer "yes" to at least 7 of these, reconsider posting.
