# Grant Writing Assistant

## Core Philosophy

Funding proposals are persuasive documents that must simultaneously demonstrate scientific rigor, innovative thinking, practical feasibility, and broader significance. Every section should answer: "Why should we fund this work?"

## Proposal Components

### 1. Executive Summary / Abstract
- Concise overview of the entire project
- Problem, approach, and expected outcomes
- Often the only section some reviewers read carefully

### 2. Specific Aims / Objectives
- Clear, measurable goals
- Typically 2-4 aims for most grants
- Each aim should be independently valuable

### 3. Significance / Background
- Establish the problem's importance
- Demonstrate knowledge of the field
- Identify the gap your work addresses

### 4. Innovation Statement
- What's new about your approach?
- How does it advance beyond current methods?
- Technical and conceptual innovation

### 5. Research Strategy / Approach
- Detailed methodology
- Experimental design and rationale
- Alternative approaches if primary fails

### 6. Preliminary Data
- Evidence supporting feasibility
- Pilot results demonstrating capability
- Essential for most NIH and many other grants

### 7. Timeline and Milestones
- Realistic project schedule
- Clear deliverables at each stage
- Demonstrates planning and feasibility

### 8. Team and Environment
- Qualifications of key personnel
- Institutional resources available
- Collaborative arrangements

### 9. Budget and Justification
- Detailed cost breakdown
- Clear connection between costs and activities
- Follow agency guidelines precisely

### 10. Broader Impacts
- Societal benefits beyond science
- Training and education components
- Outreach and dissemination plans

## Agency-Specific Guidance

### NSF (National Science Foundation)
- Equal weight on Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts
- Strong emphasis on societal benefit
- Integration of research and education valued

### NIH (National Institutes of Health)
- Five review criteria: Significance, Investigator, Innovation, Approach, Environment
- Preliminary data strongly expected
- Clinical relevance for translational work

### DOE (Department of Energy)
- Energy and environmental mission alignment
- Often requires cost-sharing
- Laboratory partnerships valued

### DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)
- High-risk, high-reward thinking
- Transformative potential emphasized
- Clear transition pathway needed

### Foundations
- Mission alignment critical
- Often more flexible formatting
- Relationship building important

## Writing Strategies

### Persuasive Techniques
- Lead with the problem's significance
- Use concrete examples and data
- Anticipate and address concerns
- Build narrative momentum

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overpromising results
- Vague methodology
- Ignoring feasibility concerns
- Missing page or format requirements
- Weak significance statement

### Review Process Understanding
- Proposals typically reviewed by peers
- Reviewers have limited time per proposal
- Make key points easy to find
- Use clear headings and structure

## Proposal Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Analyze announcement, identify fit, outline approach
2. **Drafting**: Write sections, gather supporting materials
3. **Internal Review**: Get colleague feedback, revise
4. **Finalization**: Polish writing, check compliance
5. **Submission**: Follow agency procedures exactly

## Integration

Works with:
- `lit-review` for background research
- `academic-writing` for prose quality
- `hypothesis-dev` for research design
- `reference-management` for citations
