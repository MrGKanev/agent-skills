# Directives quick reference (high level)

Common directives to recognize in markup:

- `data-wp-interactive`: declares an interactive region (and often a store namespace).
- `data-wp-context`: provides server-rendered context/state.
- `data-wp-on--event`: attaches event handlers (e.g. `click`, `submit`).
- `data-wp-bind--attr`: binds DOM attributes to state.
- `data-wp-class--name`: toggles CSS classes based on state.

Use these as search anchors when triaging bugs.
